# Frequently Asked Questions
As we receive and answer questions that we feel may be useful for the everyone, we'll update this document.

Q: Do I have to print a cover for the master assembly?
A: While not critical to the basic function of your assembly, a cover is STRONGLY recommended. It helps to prevent off-axis insertions, keeps dust out of delicate electrical connections, and provides strain relief for hot end wiring.

Q: The mag lever assembly has a lot of play - is this a problem?
A: When assembled, the mag lever should feel quite loose. This is so that, when a tool plate is engaged, the mag lever does not exert any unwanted axial forces on the tool assembly.
